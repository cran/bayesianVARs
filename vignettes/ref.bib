abstract = {We present a framework aimed to reveal directed interactions of activated brain areas using time-resolved fMRI and vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling in the context of Granger causality. After describing the underlying mathematical concepts, we present simulations helping to characterize the conditions under which VAR modeling and Granger causality can reveal directed interactions from fluctuations in BOLD-like signal time courses. We apply the proposed approach to a dynamic sensorimotor mapping paradigm. In an event-related fMRI experiment, subjects performed a visuomotor mapping task for which the mapping of two stimuli (“faces” vs “houses”) to two responses (“left” or “right”) alternated periodically between the two possible mappings. Besides expected activity in sensory and motor areas, a fronto-parietal network was found to be active during presentation of a cue indicating a change in the stimulus-response (S-R) mapping. The observed network includes the superior parietal lobule and premotor areas. These areas might be involved in setting up and maintaining stimulus-response associations. The Granger causality analysis revealed a directed influence exerted by the left lateral prefrontal cortex and premotor areas on the left posterior parietal cortex.}

abstract = {Abstract In this article a multi-subject vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling approach was proposed for inference on effective connectivity based on resting-state functional MRI data. Their framework uses a Bayesian variable selection approach to allow for simultaneous inference on effective connectivity at both the subject- and group-level. Furthermore, it accounts for multi-modal data by integrating structural imaging information into the prior model, encouraging effective connectivity between structurally connected regions. They demonstrated through simulation studies that their approach resulted in improved inference on effective connectivity at both the subject- and group-level, compared with currently used methods. It was concluded by illustrating the method on temporal lobe epilepsy data, where resting-state functional MRI and structural MRI were used.

 abstract={This paper introduces JASP, a free graphical software package for basic statistical procedures such as t tests, ANOVAs, linear regression models, and analyses of contingency tables. JASP is open-source and differentiates itself from existing open-source solutions in two ways. First, JASP provides several innovations in user interface design; specifically, results are provided immediately as the user makes changes to options, output is attractive, minimalist, and designed around the principle of progressive disclosure, and analyses can be peer reviewed without requiring a &amp;quot;syntax&amp;quot;. Second, JASP provides some of the recent developments in Bayesian hypothesis testing and Bayesian parameter estimation. The ease with which these relatively complex Bayesian techniques are available in JASP encourages their broader adoption and furthers a more inclusive statistical reporting practice. The JASP analyses are implemented in R and a series of R packages.},
